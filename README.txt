Using this game
---------------
Due to client->server->client control delay it is recommended that this game is used in singleplayer or in local multiplayer.
Generation of new areas of world may slightly affect the control response of the vehicle, the best control response will occur in previously generated areas.
Left arrow and right arrow blocks are given to a new player to mark out a race track.
Third-person camera mode is recommended when driving for a better view.

How to start playing this game
------------------------------
Decoration placement must be disabled, this can be done in the 'All Settings' menu (Settings tab -> All Settings -> Mapgen -> Mapgen flags) or by adding the line below to your minetet.conf file:
mg_flags = caves,dungeons,light,nodecorations,biomes

Start a new world, the game will only allow 'Mapgen Flat' to be selected.

When you enter the world, if the screen is black you are probably inside a tree, walk in various directions to exit the tree.

Type '/grantme all' to obtain all privileges.

Press 'K' to enable fly mode, and 'J' to enable fast mode.

Fly fast to find some track, it might take a minute or more to find it.

Place the car on the track, enter it. Press 'F7' to use third-person camera mode.
